			<h3>Open Source Programs</h3>
			<p class="paragraph">The programs listed began as intentional tools to help get a task done. Sometimes the best program for a task is one heavily used day-to-day. Programs I list here are those I invested considerable effort as well as use daily or often. Some of them I have invested <b>years</b> of personal time outside of a regular job. Some of those programs were an active part of my personal life. Other programs I describe here may have been involved in research I conducted. The good ones are listed in the event others find them useful.</p>

			<h3>Gautier RSS</h3>
			<p class="paragraph">Shows feeds from the Internet. The reader is the <b><i>fastest</i></b> way to view information from multiple websites. The biggest benefit is it saves time keeping up with information from a website. Many websites publish content in a separate feed channel. The feed stream must be in the RSS or Atom format. While the reader is open, it will list new feed items. You can access the <b>full page</b> of information for a feed item in a web browser when you click the <b>View Article</b> button. Otherwise, full summary information is shown in the program's <b>quick view</b> to the right-side of a selected article.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">The official name of the project is <a href="https://www.github.com/michaelgautier/gautier_rss_reader7/" target="_blank">Gautier RSS Reader 7</a>. The project site includes the latest source code. Gautier RSS is at version 7 with several <a href="https://github.com/michaelgautier/gautier_rss_reader7/releases" target="_blank">sub-releases</a>. Over time, the project rolls over to a major release with its own source repository.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Individual releases represent significant milestones in the project's history. Future releases may include .deb and .rpm install packages. Those are the package formats I have privately created for Linux-based operating systems that understand those package formats. That includes operating systems derived from Debian and Red Hat. The program has been tested on the latest official versions Ubuntu and Fedora.</p>
